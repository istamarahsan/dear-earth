## Getting Started

This repository is a monorepo containing a Flutter app and a [PocketBase](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase) configuration.

### Flutter app

You will need to have Flutter installed on your computer.

```bash
# flutter app directory
cd flutter-app/dearearth

# dependencies
flutter pub get

cd pocketbase

# run via docker compose
docker compose up --build
```
